## Project Overview

This project models a fixed-coupon bond and quantifies its **interest rate risk** by computing:

- **Macaulay Duration**  
- **Modified Duration**  
- **DV01 (Dollar Value of 01)** across multiple tenor points on the curve (1Y to 5Y)

The interest rate curve is modeled using spot rates provided at 3.5Y, 4.5Y, and 5.5Y maturities. Interpolation is applied to estimate spot rates for intermediate tenors.

|------------------|------------------------|
| Face Value       | â‚¹1,000,000 (INR)       |
| Coupon Rate      | 8% p.a. (semi-annual)  |
| Maturity         | 10 years               |

## Objectives

1. Compute the **present value** of cash flows and the **market price** of the bond.
2. Estimate the **Macaulay and Modified durations** using discount factors from interpolated rates.
3. Calculate the **DV01 (Price sensitivity to a 1 basis point rate change)** at:
   - 1 Year
   - 2 Years
   - 3 Years
   - 4 Years
   - 5 Years
